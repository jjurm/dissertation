  abstract = {Gephi is an open source software for graph and network analysis. It uses a 3D render engine to display large networks in real-time and to speed up the exploration. A flexible and multi-task architecture brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce valuable visual results. We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering , navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network visualization.},

We use random networks of varying sizes and densities and subject them (separately) to four kinds of random error in varying amounts. The types of error are edge deletion, node deletion, edge addition, and node addition. The results show that the accuracy of centrality measures declines smoothly and predictably with the amount of error. This suggests that, for random networks and random error, we shall be able to construct confidence intervals around centrality scores. In addition, centrality measures were highly similar in their response to error. Dense networks were the most robust in the face of all kinds of error except edge deletion. For edge deletion, sparse networks were more accurately measured.},

  abstract = {Protein interaction databases often provide confidence scores for each recorded interaction based on the available experimental evidence. Protein interaction networks (PINs) are then built by thresholding on these scores, so that only interactions of sufficiently high quality are included. These networks are used to identify biologically relevant motifs or nodes using metrics such as degree or betweenness centrality. This type of analysis can be sensitive to the choice of threshold. If a node metric is to be useful for extracting biological signal, it should induce similar node rankings across PINs obtained at different reasonable confidence score thresholds. We propose three measures—rank continuity, identifiability, and instability—to evaluate how robust a node metric is to changes in the score threshold. We apply our measures to twenty-five metrics and identify four as the most robust: the number of edges in the step-1 ego network, as well as the leave-one-out differences in average redundancy, average number of edges in the step-1 ego network, and natural connectivity. Our measures show good agreement across PINs from different species and data sources. Analysis of synthetically generated scored networks shows that robustness results are context-specific, and depend both on network topology and on how scores are placed across network edges. Due to the uncertainty associated with protein interaction detection, and therefore network structure, for PIN analysis to be reproducible, it should yield similar results across different confidence score thresholds. We demonstrate that while certain node metrics are robust with respect to threshold choice, this is not always the case. Promisingly, our results suggest that there are some metrics that are robust across networks constructed from different databases, and different scoring procedures.},

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/. To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

This salesperson has a map (a weighted graph) in which each city has an attached demand specifying the number of brushes that can be sold in that city. What is the best route to take to sell the quota while traveling the least distance possible? Notice that unlike the standard traveling salesman problem, not only do we need to figure out the order in which to visit the cities, but we must decide the more fundamental question: which cities do we want to visit? In this paper we give the first approximation algorithm having a polylogarithmic performance guarantee for this problem, as well as for the slightly more general " prize-collecting traveling sales-man problem " (PCTSP) of Balas, and a variation we call the " bank robber problem " (also called the " orienteering problem " by Golden, Levi, and Vohra). We do this by providing an O(log 2 k) approx-imation to the somewhat cleaner k-MST problem which is defined as follows. Given an undirected graph on n nodes with nonnegative edge weights and an integer k ≤ n, find the tree of least weight that spans k vertices. (If desired, one may specify in the problem a " root vertex " that must be in the tree as well.) Our result improves on the previous best bound of O(√ k) of Ravi et al.},

In particular, network topology measures from graph theory have been adapted to analyze network efficiency and ‘small-world’ properties. While there has been a surge in the number of papers examining connectivity through graph theory, questions remain about its test-retest reliability (TRT). In particular, the reproducibility of structural connectivity measures has not been assessed. We examined the TRT of global connectivity measures generated from graph theory analyses of 17 young adults who underwent two high-angular resolution diffusion (HARDI) scans approximately 3 months apart. Of the measures assessed, modularity had the highest TRT, and it was stable across a range of sparsities (a thresholding parameter used to define which network edges are retained). These reliability measures underline the need to develop network descriptors that are robust to acquisition parameters.},

  abstract = {Graph theory (GT) is a powerful framework for quantifying topological features of neuroimaging-derived functional and structural networks. However, false positive (FP) connections arise frequently and influence the inferred topology of networks. Thresholding is often used to overcome this problem, but an appropriate threshold often relies on a priori assumptions, which will alter inferred network topologies.Four common network metrics (global efficiency, mean clustering coefficient, mean betweenness and smallworldness) were tested using a model tractography dataset. It was found that all four network metrics were significantly affected even by just one FP. Results also show that thresholding effectively dampens the impact of FPs, but at the expense of adding significant bias to network metrics.In a larger number (n= 248) of tractography datasets, statistics were computed across random group permutations for a range of thresholds, revealing that statistics for network metrics varied significantly more than for non-network metrics (i.e., number of streamlines and number of edges). Varying degrees of network atrophy were introduced artificially to half the datasets, to test sensitivity to genuine group differences. For some network metrics, this atrophy was detected as significant (p{$<$}. 0.05, determined using permutation testing) only across a limited range of thresholds.We propose a multi-threshold permutation correction (MTPC) method, based on the cluster-enhanced permutation correction approach, to identify sustained significant effects across clusters of thresholds. This approach minimises requirements to determine a single threshold a priori. We demonstrate improved sensitivity of MTPC-corrected metrics to genuine group effects compared to an existing approach and demonstrate the use of MTPC on a previously published network analysis of tractography data derived from a clinical population.In conclusion, we show that there are large biases and instability induced by thresholding, making statistical comparisons of network metrics difficult. However, by testing for effects across multiple thresholds using MTPC, true group differences can be robustly identified.}

Some effort has been made to present new applications that do not use merely the notation and ter minology of graphs but do actually implement some mathematical results from graph theory. It has been written for final undergraduate year or first year graduate students in engineering, mathematics, computer science, and operations research, as well as researchers and practitioners with an inter est in graph theoretic modelling. Suggested plans for the reading of the book by people with these interests are given later. The book comprises two parts. The first is a brief introduction to the mathematical theory of graphs. The second is a discussion on the applications of this material to some areas in the subjects previously mentioned. It is, of course, possi ble to read only the first part to attempt to gain an appreciation of the mathematical aspects of graph theory.

Among a number of large-scale experiments for assigning certain functional classes to proteins, experiments determining protein-protein interaction are especially important because interacting proteins usually have the same function. Thus, it seems possible to predict the function of a protein when the function of its interacting partner is known. However, in vitro experiments often suffer from artifacts and a protein can often have multiple binding partners with different functions. We developed an objective prediction method that can systematically include the information of indirect interaction. Our method can predict the subcellular localization, the cellular role and the biochemical function of yeast proteins with accuracies of 72.7\%, 63.6\% and 52.7\%, respectively. The prediction accuracy rises for proteins with more than three binding partners and thus we present the open prediction results for 16 such proteins.},

In the cited areas, a surprisingly large number of very heterogeneous data can be modeled as networks and consequently, a unified representation of networks can be used to gain insight into many kinds of problems. Due to the emergence of the World Wide Web in the last decades many such datasets are now openly available. The KONECT project thus has the goal of collecting many diverse network datasets from the Web, and providing a way for their systematic study. The main parts of KONECT are (1) a collection of over 160 network datasets, consisting of directed, undirected, unipartite, bipartite, weighted, unweighted, signed and temporal networks collected from the Web, (2) a Matlab toolbox for network analysis and (3) a website giving a compact overview the various computed statistics and plots. In this paper, we describe KONECT's taxonomy of networks datasets, give an overview of the datasets included, review the supported statistics and plots, and briefly discuss KONECT's role in the area of web science and network science.},

  abstract = {Measuring the impact of network attack is an important issue in network science. In this paper, we study the impact of maximal vertex coverage (MVC) attack in large complex networks, where the attacker aims at deleting as many edges of the network as possible by attacking a small fraction of nodes. First, we present two metrics to measure the impact of MVC attack. To compute these metrics, we propose an efficient randomized greedy algorithm with near-optimal performance guarantee. Second, we generalize the MVC attack into an uncertain setting, in which a node is deleted by the attacker with a prior probability. We refer to the MVC attack under such uncertain environment as the probabilistic MVC attack. Based on the probabilistic MVC attack, we propose two adaptive metrics, and then present an adaptive greedy algorithm for calculating such metrics accurately and efficiently. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 real datasets. The results show that P2P and co-authorship networks are extremely robust under the MVC attack while both the online social networks and the Email communication networks exhibit vulnerability under the MVC attack. In addition, the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for computing the proposed metrics. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Network data have been obtained via surveys and questionnaires, archives, observation, diaries, electronic traces, and experiments. Most methodological research on data quality concerns surveys and questionnaires. The question of the accuracy with which informants can provide data on their network ties is nontrivial, but survey methods can make some claim to reliability. Unresolved issues include whether to measure perceived social ties or actual exchanges, how to treat temporal elements in the definition of relationships, and whether to seek accurate descriptions or reliable indicators. Continued research on data quality is needed; beyond improved samples and further investigation of the informant accuracy/reliability issue, this should cover common indices of network structure, address the consequences of sampling portions of a network, and examine the robustness of indicators of network structure and position to both random and nonrandom errors of measurement.},

One such package is JGraphT, a programming library which contains very efficient and generic graph data-structures along with a large collection of state-of-the-art algorithms. The library is written in Java with stability, interoperability and performance in mind. A distinctive feature of this library is the ability to model vertices and edges as arbitrary objects, thereby permitting natural representations of many common networks including transportation, social and biological networks. Besides classic graph algorithms such as shortest-paths and spanning-tree algorithms, the library contains numerous advanced algorithms: graph and subgraph isomorphism; matching and flow problems; approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems such as independent set and TSP; and several more exotic algorithms such as Berge graph detection. Due to its versatility and generic design, JGraphT is currently used in large-scale commercial, non-commercial and academic research projects. In this work we describe in detail the design and underlying structure of the library, and discuss its most important features and algorithms. A computational study is conducted to evaluate the performance of JGraphT versus a number of similar libraries. Experiments on a large number of graphs over a variety of popular algorithms show that JGraphT is highly competitive with other established libraries such as NetworkX or the BGL.},

The data produced by these experiments are often rich and multimodal, yet at the same time they may contain substantial measurement error. In practice, this means that the true network structure can differ greatly from naive estimates made from the raw data, and hence that conclusions drawn from those naive estimates may be significantly in error. In this paper we describe a technique that circumvents this problem and allows us to make optimal estimates of the true structure of networks in the presence of both richly textured data and significant measurement uncertainty. We give example applications to two different social networks, one derived from face-to-face interactions and one from self-reported friendships.},

If the perturbed and unperturbed systems have the same RHP poles, then it is possible to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for robustness with respect to a given class of perturbations. As an application of these results, the design of stabilizing controllers for unstable singularly perturbed systems is studied.},

  abstract = {The continuously increasing complexity of communication networks and the increasing diversity and unpredictability of traffic demand has led to a consensus view that the automation of the management process is inevitable. Currently, network and service management techniques are mostly manual, requiring human intervention, and leading to slow response times, high costs, and customer dissatisfaction. In this paper we present AutoNet, a self-organizing management system for core networks where robustness to environmental changes, namely traffic shifts, topology changes, and community of interest is viewed as critical. A framework to design robust control strategies for autonomic networks is proposed. The requirements of the network are translated to graph-theoretic metrics and the management system attempts to automatically evolve to a stable and robust control point by optimizing these metrics. The management approach is inspired by ideas from evolutionary science where a metric, network criticality, measures the survival value or robustness of a particular network configuration. In our system, network criticality is a measure of the robustness of the network to environmental changes. The control system is designed to direct the evolution of the system state in the direction of increasing robustness. As an application of our framework, we propose a traffic engineering method in which different paths are ranked based on their robustness measure, and the best path is selected to route the flow. The choice of the path is in the direction of preserving the robustness of the network to the unforeseen changes in topology and traffic demands. Furthermore, we develop a method for capacity assignment to optimize the robustness of the network.},

Instead of considering average network performance under random failure, we compute approximate network performance probability density functions as functions of the fraction of nodes removed. We find that targeted attacks based on centrality measures give a good indication of the worst-case behavior of a network. We show that many centrality measures produce similar targeted attacks and that a combination of degree centrality and eigenvector centrality may be enough to evaluate worst-case behavior of networks. Finally, we study the robustness envelope and targeted attack responses of networks that are rewired to have high- and low-degree assortativities, discovering that moderate assortativity increases confer more robustness against targeted attacks whilst moderate decreases confer more robustness against random uniform attacks.},

Information on structural networks in the brain can be obtained in-vivo by performing tractography on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. However, little is known about the reproducibility of network properties derived from whole brain tractography data, which has important consequences for minimally detectable abnormalities or changes over time. Moreover, acquisition parameters, such as the number of gradient directions and gradient strength, possibly influence network metrics and the corresponding reproducibility derived from tractography data. The aim of the present study is twofold: (i) to determine the effect of several clinically available DTI sampling schemes, differing in number of gradient directions and gradient amplitude, on small world metrics and (ii) to evaluate the interscan reproducibility of small world metrics. DTI experiments were conducted on six healthy volunteers scanned twice. Probabilistic tractography was performed to reconstruct structural connections between regions defined from an anatomical atlas. The observed reproducibility of the network measures was high, reflected by low values for the coefficient of variation ({$<$}3.8\%), advocating the use of graph theoretical measurements to study neurological diseases. Small world metrics were dependent on the choice of DTI gradient scheme and showed stronger connectivity with increasing directional resolution. The interscan reproducibility was not dependent on the gradient scheme. These findings should be considered when comparing results across studies using different gradient schemes or designing new studies.},

A second subsystem consisted of vOT and anterior fusiform gyrus along with hippocampus and intraparietal sulcus. The two subsystems were linked through a unique connection between vOT and GTm, which were hubs with a high betweenness centrality compared to STS and GFi which had a high local clustering coefficient.

We embed missing data, which we term false negative nodes and edges, in a broader classification of error scenarios. This includes false positive nodes and edges and falsely aggregated and disaggregated nodes. We simulate these six measurement errors using an online social network and a publication citation network, reporting their effects on four node-level measures - degree centrality, clustering coefficient, network constraint, and eigenvector centrality. Our results suggest that in networks with more positively-skewed degree distributions and higher average clustering, these measures tend to be less resistant to most forms of measurement error. In addition, we argue that the sensitivity of a given measure to an error scenario depends on the idiosyncracies of the measure's calculation, thus revising the general claim from past research that the more 'global' a measure, the less resistant it is to measurement error. Finally, we anchor our discussion to commonly-used networks in past research that suffer from these different forms of measurement error and make recommendations for correction strategies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Graph analysis is a promising tool to quantify brain connectivity. However, an essential requirement is that the graph measures are reproducible and robust. We have studied the reproducibility and robustness of various graph measures in group based and in individual binary and weighted networks derived from a task fMRI experiment during explicit associative-semantic processing of words and pictures. The nodes of the network were defined using an independent study and the connectivity was based on the partial correlation of the time series between any pair of nodes. The results showed that in case of binary networks, global graph measures exhibit a good reproducibility and robustness for networks which are not too sparse and these figures of merit depend on the graph measure and on the density of the network. Furthermore, group based binary networks should be derived from groups of sufficient size and the lower the density the more subjects are required to obtain robust values. Local graph measures are very variable in terms of reproducibility and should be interpreted with care. For weighted networks, we found good reproducibility (average test-retest variability {$<$}5\% and ICC values {$>$}0.4) when using subject specific networks and this will allow us to relate network properties to individual subject information.},

  abstract = {The concept of natural connectivity is reported as a robustness measure of complex networks. The natural connectivity has a clear physical meaning and a simple mathematical formulation. It is shown that the natural connectivity can be derived mathematically from the graph spectrum as an average eigenvalue and that it changes strictly monotonically with the addition or deletion of edges. By comparing the natural connectivity with other typical robustness measures within a scenario of edge elimination, it is demonstrated that the natural connectivity has an acute discrimination which agrees with our intuition.},

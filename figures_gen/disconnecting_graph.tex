\caption{Illustrated is how thresholding (a subgraph of) a protein network (left) results in one giant component (red) and multiple small disconnected components.
The left is a certain subgraph of the \textit{ecoli} dataset (all edges with confidence $>0.4$), the right graph has only edges with confidence $>0.5$.}

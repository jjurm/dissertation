\section{Problem background}

\subsection{Graphs}

Graphs (or networks) from graph theory usually consist of \textit{components} (or nodes, vertices) and \textit{links} between them (edges).
Some of the definitions in this subsection are based on the book \textsl{A first course in network theory}\cite{Estrada2017}.

\begin{definition}[Graph]
    Let $V$ be a finite set of $n$ nodes (or vertices), and let $E \subseteq V \times V$ be a set of edges.\\
    A \textbf{graph} $G$ is a pair $(V, E)$, also called a \textbf{network}.\\
    $V$ is the \textbf{node set} of $G$, and $E$ is the \textbf{edge set} of $G$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
I also define the following graph

\begin{definition}[Graph properties]
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
        \item $G$ is \textbf{reflexive} iff $\forall v \in V.\ (v, v) \in E$
        \item $G$ is \textbf{anti-reflexive} iff $\forall v \in V.\ (v, v) \notin E$
        \item $G$ is \textbf{undirected} (or \textbf{symmetric}) iff $\forall v_1, v_2 \in V.\ (v_1, v_2) \in E \Leftrightarrow (v_2, v_1) \in E$
        \item $G$ is \textbf{directed} iff it is not undirected
        \item $G$ is a \textbf{simple graph} iff it is anti-reflexive and undirected
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Relations on graphs]
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
        \item $G' = (V', E')$ is a \textbf{subgraph} of $G = (V, E)$ iff $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$
        \item Let $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (v_2, E_2)$, then $G_1 \cup G_2 = (V_1 \cup V_2, E_1 \cup E_2)$ is the \textbf{union} of the two graphs, and $G_1 \cap G_2 = (V_1 {\cap} V_2, E_1 {\cap} E_2)$ is the \textbf{intersection} of the two graphs.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Node adjacency]
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
        \item In an undirected graph, $v_1$ is \textbf{adjacent} to $v_2$ iff $(v_1, v_2) \in E$
        \item A \textbf{loop} is an edge of the form $(v, v)$.
        Note that simple graphs have no loops.
        \item Define $\deg^-(v) = \left| \Set{v' \in V}{(v', v) \in E} \right|$ to be the \textbf{indegree} of $v$, and $\deg^+(v) = \left| \Set{v' \in V}{(v, v') \in E} \right|$ to be the \textbf{outdegree} of $v$, in other words, the number of incoming and outcoming edges, respectively.
        If the graph is undirected, then $\deg^-(v) = \deg^+(v) = \deg(v)$ is called \textbf{degree}.
        \item For $G = (V, E)$ with $V = {1, 2, \dots, n}$, define $A = (a_{ij})$ to be the \textbf{adjacency matrix} of $G$ where
        \[ a_{ij} = \begin{cases}
                        1, & \textnormal{if}\ (i, j) \in E \\
                        0, & \textnormal{if}\ (i, j) \notin E
        \end{cases} \]
        for $1 \leq i, j \leq n$.
        Note that adjacency matrix of undirected graph is symmetric.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Networks}

Moving towards real-world data, graphs often emerge from a certain source in the world.
Just a few examples of the data possibly represented by graphs include social networks, road networks, computer networks, protein interaction networks, citation networks, web networks and so on.
In this work I distinguish graphs and networks, although I may sometimes interchange these two.

\begin{definition}[Network]
    A \textbf{network} is a graph whose nodes or edges can have attributes $\textnormal{attr}_v, \textnormal{attr}_e : \Sigma^* \rightarrow \mathbb{U}$ for some set of possible identifiers $\Sigma^*$ (such as a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$) and a value domain $\mathbb{U}$ (such as $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{R}^2$)
\end{definition}

Graphs and networks allow capturing the same structure, however, the main difference is that nodes of a network are \textit{identifiable}, while we rarely consider \textit{identity} of graph nodes.
%This is because nodes and edges of graphs coming from real-world are often (nearly) isomorphic to real-world objects and relations between them.
There may be either an exact or inexact matching between nodes/edges in the graph and objects/relations in the real world where the data came from (depending on whether the dataset is an approximation of the world).
I will often use networks when describing knowledge of the world.

\begin{definition}[Graph matching]
    Given two graphs $G = (V, E)$ and $G' = (V', E')$ derived from the same network, define \textbf{graph matching}, $M$, to be a bijection $V \leftrightarrow V'$ such that $(v, v') \in M$ iff $v, v'$ correspond to, or come from the same node in the network.
\end{definition}

For measuring metric robustness it will be beneficial to know matching between multiple graphs coming from the same dataset, or in other words to preserve identity of nodes across such graphs.

\subsection{Graph metrics}

Metrics are essentially functions of graphs that assign a value to each node.
Metrics allow quantifying various properties of graphs, identifying \textit{important} nodes in different contexts, describing graph structures, comparing different graphs and more.
I am studying metrics as they are prominent and becoming even more crucial in analysing graphs of ever-growing real-world data.
With the increasing scale of emerging network datasets, it is becoming less possible to comprehend network structures just by visualisations.
Hence metrics are used to quantify properties of networks or their nodes.

\subsubsection{Degree centrality}

One of the simplest metrics, degree centrality, assigns to each node its degree in the graph.

\begin{definition}
    For a graph $G = (V, E)$, define \textbf{degree centrality} $DC : V \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ to be
    \[ DC(v) \eqdef \deg(v) = \left| \Set{v' \in V}{(v', v) \in E} \right| \]
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{PageRank}
= Katz centrality, but divide each vertex's contribution by its out-degree

\subsection{Datasets}

Although the framework built is universal and is not bound to any datasets, I chose a number of datasets for evaluation.

\subsubsection{Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection}

The \textit{Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection}\cite{Large2016} provides open datasets obtained from real-world data such as social networks, citation networks, web graphs, internet networks, road networks and many more.

\subsubsection{STRING database}

\textit{STRING}\cite{Szklarczyk2019} is an open database of interactions between proteins.
At the time of writing, the database contains over 24M different proteins from over 5K organisms.

Considering the whole graph as an input for this project would be unsuitable because of its size, but for the evaluation, sub-graphs of proteins of only certain organisms will be used.

Note that, generally, one cannot just consider a sub-graph of a source graph (such as sub-graph of a social network), because the generated sub-graph doesn't have a semantic meaning, and its characteristic heavily depend on how the graph was generated (for example, $n$ friends of one person would result in a more connected graph than $n$ random people in the world).
However, sub-graphs of the STRING database built from proteins of concrete organism can be used, because such graphs alone have a semantic meaning.

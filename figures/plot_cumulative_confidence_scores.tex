    \caption{Cumulative (right-to-left) distribution of the confidence scores of edges in 3 scored protein interaction networks.
    The decrease rate in the highlighted interval $[0.6,0.7]$ is used to determine the average ratio of deleted edges at each threshold, seen in \autoref{fig:plot_edge_deletion_per_step}.}

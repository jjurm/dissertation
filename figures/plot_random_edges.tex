    \caption{Validation of the \texttt{random-edges} experiment against \texttt{reproduce} and results of The Paper, using RankIdentifiability and RankInstability (displayed separately) on 7 metrics across 3 datasets.
    Thin lines inside each color band band show robustness of individual datasets, and the thick line shows the average robustness across the 3 datasets.
    Each line style (solid, long dashes, short dashes) corresponds to results obtained from different experiment or source.}

    \begin{flushleft}
        High values of RankIdentifiability mean high \textsl{robustness}, whereas high values of RankInstability mean low \textsl{robustness}.
        Metrics are sorted from left to right by their decreasing combined robustness.

    \caption{Comparison of results from The Paper and \graffs.
    Each color corresponds to one robustness measure.
    Bands show the range of measured values across the 3 datasets, and lines show the average.
    Solid and dashed bands correspond to results obtained by \graffs and The Paper, respectively.}

    High values of RankContinuity and RankIdentifiability mean high robustness, whereas high values of RankInstability mean low robustness.
    Metrics are sorted from left to right by their decreasing combined robustness.
